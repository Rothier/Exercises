# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 385  The square of the sum of the first ten natural
# numbers is 3025. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square
# of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
# numbers and the square of the sum.
